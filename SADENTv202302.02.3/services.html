<br>During routine checkup appointments, our dedicated team of clinicians carefully inspect your teeth for any possible signs of cavities. If there are signs of cavitation, we hope to fill the hole as soon as possible.
<br>At SmileArts, we employ the use of the Diagnodent, a laser decay detection device which is effective in spotting early stages of cavitation that are difficult to detect with the naked eye. This allows our clinicians to treat the small holes painlessly and conservatively, without the need for injections.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>

One of the greatest advantages of bonded tooth colored fillings is in its ability to stick to tooth structure as compared to silver mercury fillings. Silver mercury fillings require dentists to prepare a dimensional cavity form to hold the material. This often leads to increase in size of the hole and removal of more unaffected tooth structure. 
<br>The use of bonded tooth colored fillings omits the need to enlarge cavity size, allowing the clinician to treat the hole as conservatively as possible. At SmileArts, we are a mercury free practice and only restore teeth with bonded tooth colored materials.&nbsp;<br></p>

They come in many shades of white, thus allowing the dentist to match the filling to the original color of an individual's teeth.
<br>They consists of a mixture of resin and finely grounded glass-like particles. Composite fillings provide adequate durability and fracture toughness for small to medium sized cavities. They are routinely used to restore cavities on biting surfaces of back teeth. Because of their ability to be adhesively bonded to teeth, less tooth structure is removed when the dentist prepares the tooth and this inevitably results in a smaller filling than that of an amalgam filling.
<br>The bonding process of composite fillings usually takes longer to perform as compared to an amalgam filling. This is because the tooth surface needs to be carefully treated before inserting the composite material. It is then sculpted to an ideal tooth shape, hardened and polished for an natural smile, all within one visit.
<br>When teeth are chipped, decayed or have gaps in-between, bonded composite fillings may be an ideal restorative material of choice.&nbsp;<br></p>

                                    <p class="mbr-fonts-style panel-text display-7">Large silver mercury fillings have the tendency to crack teeth as they are harder than tooth structure and act like a wedge every time you bite or chew. The crack or fracture in the teeth can cause pain and may ultimately lead to the loss of the teeth. Remember, mercury is used in thermometers because it expands and contracts with temperature differences. Imagine what it can do to your teeth over time!
<br>Porcelain inlays and onlays are inserts of ceramic glass material that are bonded or fused to the tooth with minimal removal of healthy tooth structure. Because they are tooth colored and possess high strength and durability, they are often used to replace large silver mercury fillings for patients who desire a more natural looking smile. The bonding properties of porcelain to tooth structure enables the tooth to regain a proportion of its original strength and eliminates the wedging effect inherent in silver mercury fillings.
<br>Porcelain inlays and onlays are indicated for;
<br>Large cavities where composite fillings or other bonding materials are not suitable
<br>Chipped or fractured teeth
<br>Closing gaps in-between back teeth that trap food particles
<br>Strengthening root canal treated teeth by covering weak surfaces
<br>Replacing unsightly silver mercury fillings&nbsp;<br></p>

At SmileArts Dental Studio, we open your eyes to customized treatment options that can solve your dental worries and help you achieve the smile you desire.<br> 
<br><strong>Aesthetic Composite Bonded Fillings
</strong><br>Aesthetic composite bonded fillings are used to correct chipped and decayed teeth. They are also used to close gaps in-between front teeth. Patients with unsightly defective silver fillings now routinely request for aesthetic composite bonded fillings. These restorations not only mimic the beauty of natural teeth, they bond teeth together, preventing teeth from fracturing.<br> 
<br><strong>Aesthetic Veneers
</strong><br>Aesthetic veneers are thin pieces of dental porcelain or composite laminates. They are bonded onto the front surfaces of teeth. Aesthetic veneers are widely used for masking the color of badly discolored teeth, reshaping malaligned front teeth and closing gaps in between front teeth.<br> 
<br><strong>Aesthetic Porcelain Inlays/Onlays
</strong><br>With the advancement of ceramic technology, worn out, fractured and defective silver mercury fillings can now be replaced by aesthetically pleasing porcelain inlay/onlays. They help to preserve tooth structure, restore strength and function back to teeth and prevent teeth from fracturing.&nbsp;<br></p>

</strong><br>Dental implants are small titanium fixtures that are used to replace missing single or multiple teeth in both young and old patients. Dental implants can be aesthetically pleasing for front teeth. They also help patients to chew better. For patients with loose dentures, dental implants can aid to stabilize and retain them.
<br>Dentine implants are routinely performed at SmileArts Dental Studios and is usually done in 2 stages. The implants are surgically inserted into the missing spaces and allowed to heal. This is followed by a few more visits for the clinician to fix on the implant prostheses.
<br>Dental implant treatment has become more popular in recent years due to its predictability and is now considered by many dental professionals as the goal standard for teeth replacement.
<br>Let's take a look at some situations where dental implants can help you.
<br><br>Single tooth replacement
<br>Multiple teeth replacement
<br>Full mouth reconstruction
<br>Implant supported overdenture<br>
<br><strong>Single tooth replacement</strong><br>Losing a tooth can be an unpleasant experience. Not only is eating efficiency affected, the aesthetics of your smile can be severely compromised. A dental implant is ideal for replacing a missing tooth, both in the front and back region of your oral cavity.
<br><br><strong>Multiple teeth replacement
</strong><br>Dental implants can also be used to replace multiple missing teeth. Rather than wearing a denture which can sometimes be uncomfortable and affect your speech and taste, dental implants offer a better alternative which mimic the function and aesthetics of natural teeth.<br>
<br><strong>Implant supported overdenture
</strong><br>If you are plagued by shaky, loose dentures, dental implants can solve your problem. Loose dentures can often be attributed to a patient having vastly resorbed gum ridges and lack of bone support. These dentures are often termed “swimming in the mouth”. Dental implants inserted into the gum ridges can help retain and stabilize dentures, improving eating efficiency and comfort.<br>
<br><strong>Full mouth reconstruction
</strong><br>Patients with fully missing dentition on upper or lower ridges and have no desire to wear dentures can now look to dental implants for full mouth implant-fixed restorations.
<br>Laser Dentistry Lasers are playing a greater role in modern dentistry. Dental lasers have multiple benefits. They simplify surgeries, stimulate faster wound healing, and reduce sensitivity and discomfort in various situations. We currently use dental lasers for treatment such as aesthetic gum recontouring, as an adjunct to periodontal (gum) and restorative procedures. Our aim is to help patients achieve good results through a simpler approach with less discomfort. Let us know your concerns, and we will try to tailor a treatment plan that meets your needs.&nbsp;<br></p>

</strong><br>Teeth whitening or dental bleaching can help you whiten your teeth and give you the smile you always wanted. Compared with other forms of dental treatment like composite resins, porcelain veneers or crowns, teeth whitening is much more conservative and non-invasive.<br>
<br><strong>What are the causes of stained/ yellow teeth?
</strong><br>Aging can cause yellowing of teeth. Food and drinks like coffee, tea, red wine can also cause staining. Other causes include smoking, defective fillings and nerve degeneration. Consumption of certain antibiotics eg tetracycline during teeth formation can also cause discoloration of teeth.<br>
<br><strong>How does teeth whitening work?
</strong><br>Teeth whitening is a process whereby oxidizing agents are placed in contact with the teeth. The oxidizing agent will gently remove the stains that are present inside teeth structure. The process is safe and does not cause any harm to the teeth.<br>
<br><strong>Teeth Whitening
</strong><br>Teeth with yellowish stains and discoloration can be whitened through the use of teeth whitening procedures. At SmileArts Dental Studio, we employ a combination of in-office and home whitening kits to achieve predictable, realistic results.
<br> 
<br><strong>Types of whitening
</strong><br>At SmileArts Dental Studio we offer 2 types of teeth whitening:<br>
<br><strong>Take home whitening:
</strong><br>This involves application of whitening gel on custom made whitening trays that fits your teeth. The trays are worn from 2 hours to overnight depending on the concentration of gel used. The process has to be done for a period of 2-3 weeks.<br>
<br><strong>In-office whitening:
</strong><br>This is done in our dental office. At SmileArts Dental Studio we use InnoWhite In-Office whitening system. A higher concentration of whitening gel is applied on the teeth and a special light is used to enhance the chemical action of the gel. The whole process takes 1- 1.5 hours.<br>
<br><strong>Does teeth whitening have any side effects?
</strong><br>Some patients may experience temporary sensitivity to the teeth after treatment. The sensitivity always disappear 1-2 days after treatment.<br>
<br><strong>How long can the results of teeth whitening last?
</strong><br>It depends on the diet and habits of the patients. Patients taking dark staining substances like coffee, tea, smoking , may need periodic re-whitening from time to time. This can be achieved with home maintenance whitening kit or in-office whitening after 2-3 years.&nbsp;<br></p>

Dental crowns in the past were often made of metal and porcelain. The metal core provided strength to the dental crown to withstand biting forces while the porcelain is layered over the metal core for white aesthetics. However, the metal core resulted in a dark blue or black line at the gum margin of the dental crown. This presented a big aesthetic problem for patients who had to do crowns in their front teeth.
<br> 
<br>With improvements in ceramic technology, it is now possible to make dental crowns entirely out of porcelain. Full porcelain crowns not only maintain a translucency similar to natural teeth, they are strong and durable. Without a metal core, porcelain crowns do not have a problem of a dark line at the gum level. This vastly improves aesthetic results and allows the dental clinician to place the edge of the full porcelain crown above the gum line which is easier to clean and keep healthy.
<br>If crowns are ever needed for your front teeth , full porcelain crowns are the ideal choice for natural looking teeth and a confident healthy smile.&nbsp;<br></p>

<br>As porcelain veneers are made in the dental laboratory, they can be customized to fit your teeth. Once porcelain veneers are bonded onto the teeth surfaces, they are very strong and can be treated like your own teeth. The final outcome is a beautiful and natural looking smile!&nbsp;<br></p>

It can be done both in children and adults. Braces can be used to help correct: crocked teeth, tilted teeth, crowded teeth and spacing between teeth. The treatment time can take anywhere from 9 months to 3 years depending on the severity of the condition.
<br><strong><br></strong><br><strong>Types of braces</strong><br><strong> 
</strong><br><em><strong>Metal brackets
</strong></em><br>Small metal brackets are attached to the front of the teeth. A fine wire goes through these metal brackets. Through the brackets and wire a small force is applied to the teeth and guides the teeth to the correct position.
<br><em><strong>Ceramic brackets
</strong></em><br>They work the same way as the metal brackets but the brackets are in ceramic. These “clear” brackets are aesthetically more pleasing compared to metal ones.
<br><em><strong>Lingual braces
</strong></em><br>These braces are fitted behind the teeth and cannot be seen.
<br><em><strong>Invisalign
</strong></em><br>Invisalign uses a series of clear transparent aligners that are custom crafted to fit and move your teeth. They can be removed and makes it easier for you to clean your teeth. No metal wires are involved and therefore they are aesthetically pleasing.
<br><em><strong>Inman Aligner
</strong></em><br>The Inman Aligner is a simple removable appliance used to align front teeth quickly and safely. It's ideal as a stand alone treatment or to prealign teeth prior to further cosmetic options such as bonding or minimal veneers. It has Nickel Titanium coil springs that power two aligner bows that gently oppose each other, guiding the teeth into their new position. These gentle forces are active over a very large range of movement, which is why the Inman Aligner works so quickly.
<br><em><strong>Retainers
</strong></em><br>At the end of braces treatment, patients are required to wear retainers to maintain their teeth position for a period of time. If the retainers are not worn as recommended, the teeth may move back to their original position.&nbsp;<br></p>

</strong><br>Biometic dentistry is a scientific advance in dental care.
<br>With each breakthrough in detal care, dentistry gets closer to the important goal of helping patients maintain strong, healthy teeth for a long time. The Biometic approach is less invasive and aims to preserve as much natural tooth structure as possible.
<br>We know that sounds great to patients! But there are important reasons why biometic dentistry is less invasive. It works precisely with dental advancements hence allowing you to keep more of your natural tooth when you need dental work.
<br>The natural tooth is built to fight off disease and hold up to wear and tear. Biometic dentistry and less drilling during treatment does the same job, leaving more natural tooth structure in place.<br>
<br><strong>Why is Biometic dentistry a breakthrough?
</strong><br>You may have heard the term “drill and fill”. While they can be necessary, fillings often start a destructive cycle that leads to root canals and crowns over time. Teeth weakened by fillings often crack or break.
<br>Studies show that biomimetic dentistry reduces these risks by conserving more of the natural tooth. Improvements in science and technology allow us to work with less drilling and less invasive dentistry.<br>

Only then should you make a decision to purchase an AgilityGuard.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Facts from the American Dental Association
